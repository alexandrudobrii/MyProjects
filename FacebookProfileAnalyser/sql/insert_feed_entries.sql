Then tourism kicked in. “The interest in Berlin’s turbulent history is huge,” said Giebel, a 64-year-old whose sales have risen 20 percent since 2011. “If I ask my customers why they’re visiting Berlin, they tell me: ‘Because everyone wants to come here’”. Berlin -- which has surpassed Rome as Europe’s third-most visited city, after London and Paris -- is the fastest growing of the continent’s top 10 destinations. The city’s economy expanded the most of all German states last year after overnight stays from tourists climbed 8.2 percent to 27 million. The boom is changing the face of a city once termed “poor but sexy” by outgoing Mayor Klaus Wowereit for a bustling nightlife that came with cheap living costs, low wages and high unemployment. While it’s a godsend for business owners like Giebel, others view the influx as an invasion of visitors rampaging through their once-quiet neighborhoods.
